So our first project was due and I had absolutly no idea what I was going to; but I did know that this project was going to challenge everything I have learned up to this point. Coming to that concution was what motivated me to use Dark souls for my project. You see I'm a gamer and I have a wide variety of games I play; that being said, no game I have played chanllenges you the way Dark souls does. To get anywhere in Dark souls you have to use every bit of knowledge you have picked up along the way. So knowing I would be using most if not all of what I have learned up to this point in coding it felt like the perfect parrallel. And so I'm making my project give you all the information you need to pick a starting class for Dark souls.
