At the time that this boot camp started, I had just had my second child. So I had one full time job, one toddler, a wife, school, and I started a second pat time job, I knew it would be a lot but I knew I needed to get started on working my way towards a career that could grow with my family, so I started anyway. I didn't anticipate how challenging it would be to balance everything. 

It feels like if I'm doing one thing well, the others suffer. I have to work my full time job, so that goes first, but when I get home I have to chose between school and spending time with my family. It sometimes feels like to do well in school I have to push my family to the side, which feels wrong. If I don't though, school suffers and I need to do well with coding to provide for my family. Then I add in the demands of my second job with Lions Eye Bank and it can get very overwhelming. I love my job at Galveston Express and am grateful for the opportunity to work with Lions but sometimes I feel that it is too much, everything all at once.

Thankfully, I am getting better at time management and managing my own expectations. All of these opportunities are making me grow as a person and develop better communication skills and unlearn some bad habits I picked up when I was younger. The first thing I realized was that I needed to stop looking at everything as a whole, and therefore thinking of all of the possible scenarios, and just focus on the task at hand. When I am at work that it what I focus on, then when I get home my focus is on my family for a little bit then when it's time for school, all I focus on is that. It helps clear my head and actually get the task at hand done. When I busy worrying and thinking of all the other things that task that is at hand suffers, and therefore I never do anything well. 

My wife is great at time management so we take some time on Monday to map out the week and understand the expectations we have for one another that week. If it's a busy week she understands that there won't be a lot of family time that week and if there is something that is important to her that I be there then some days I don't get as much school work done. It's been a hard month adjusting but we are getting the hang of it. I'm glad for the chance to implement some good habits in place of my old ones. I plan on finishing out this year strong, and starting the next year great.
