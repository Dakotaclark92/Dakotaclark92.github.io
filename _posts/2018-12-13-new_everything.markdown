Keeping a journal is hard for me, I'm not a natural writer and changing my thoughts into words can be hard; especially on a schedule. It's a new skill for me to learn that got me thinking about all of the new experiences I've had over the past couple of years. In 2015 I married my wife on June 6th and then that day we moved  into our first apartment together. Learning to live with some one was interesting and a whole lot of fun. I had no idea that day everything that we would get to go through together and how moving to Galveston would change our lives.

She had always known that she wanted to live in Galveston but I had never really thought about where I wanted to go, I had just assumed I wold end up living somewhere in East Texas because that's what everyone in my family had done; it has actually caused some friction between my family and I because everyone keeps expecting us to move back but we aren't. Three and a half years, two babies, two dogs, a house, and a couple of goats later and this is our home. It's where we've chosen to build our family and we love this town. I never expected to enjoy living here as much as I do. 

After just starting to get the hang of being a married couple we found out we were expecting or first child together, his name is Tiberius Anthony Clark. That to me was an even bigger adjustment than getting married. My wife was capable of taking care of herself, this little baby was completely dependent on me for everything. My wife wanted to stay home with him and with the cost of childcare being so high that was the best decision for us. I love getting to come home to all of them being there and happy to see me. 

Almost a year after he was born we bought our first home. I really wanted to have a yard to play with my son in and the dogs could run around in. We had not actually intended to buy our home right then, but were just pricing the market to see how much we would need to have saved up. We found a lovely home that met all of our expectations and that we could afford right then so e went for it. We moved in December 5th, 2016, just in time for Tiberius' first birthday and his fist Christmas. 

Apparently, we like doing things in one year increments because a little less than one year later we had our second child, Georgia Ray Clark. She's perfect. Having children has been the most fun thing I have ever done. Watching them grow up and develop has been amazing. They approach the world with such wonder and have so much love for everything and everyone around them. I love them both and they're my reason for striving to better myself and give them the best that I can. 

So much has happened in three years. Big life changes and little self improvements; there is always something that I'm learning. From better communication to how to raise children I never imagined my life would be where it is today and I am so grateful for the chance to keep improving my life.
