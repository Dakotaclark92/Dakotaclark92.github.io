Coding wasn't something that I was always interested in. I've always enjoyed computers and working with them, I have even built my own and my in-laws one. Coding just wasn't something that I was ever exposed to. I grew up in a little town called Martins Mill, it has one stop light and one gas station; our high school isn't even big enough to get our own football team. Just about everybody there lived on a farm or ranch and as such this was just about everyone's main focus, no one really cared about technology past what their phones could do. So coding never crossed my path until I moved to Galveston.

After I married my wife on June 6th, 2015, we moved into our first apartment together on Galveston Island. I never thought I would live in Galveston, or that I would ever leave East Texas, but my wife, Savannah, had wanted to live there since she was eight so this was a dream come true for her. I originally just transferred from the Office Depot where I worked to the one in Galveston, but not long after we moved I got offered a better job working for Galveston Express as one of their drivers. We drive people from the airports in Houston to the cruise port here in Galveston, Office Depot had been a great job but it was exciting to start something new and I have been working at Galveston Express for almost three years now.

While Galveston Express has been a wonderful job I have progressed as far as I can with it and with my family having grown again with the addition of my second kid, Georgia, I needed to look for a career that could grow with my family. So, I started looking into other options like getting a degree or going into welding. While driving though, I kept passing this billboard for FlatIron Coding Boot camp and decided to look into it. I looked up coding and all of the different jobs that require it and decided that was what I wanted to do. I love computers and loved the idea of being able to remote code from home so that I wouldn't have to miss so much of my children while they're little. I am excited to see where this road leads me.
