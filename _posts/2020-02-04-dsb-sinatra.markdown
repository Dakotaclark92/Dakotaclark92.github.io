When I went to start this project I though I was going to have a hard time, mostly because I waited almost a year inbetween finishing the sinatra courses and starting the project. I'm not going to lie at first it was quite difficult getting back into the swing of sinatra; expecially since I have been through Java. However once I started to review the old lessions and writing my code it all seemed to come back to me. Not all at once mind you, it still took longer than I would have liked to finish the project but it wasn't as complicating to get back into as I had origanally thought.

My program is like my first project based around Dark Souls with a bit of D&D Beyond inspiration. It is a tool to create a character, you can choose your name, class and gender. Once you have made it you can edit and delete the character as you see fit.

It's nice to know that even though I was out of practice with Sinatra I was still able to create a working program. I guess it gos to show that coding is like riding a bike, once you have learned it you can alway come back and ride it again.
