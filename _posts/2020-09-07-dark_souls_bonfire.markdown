So for this project I decided to create a webside that you could go and create a dark souls character with his/her class, gender, name and burial gift. Eventually I would add the ability to add wepons and armor according to what you find but I was tried for time and I fully intend to expand further on this webside in further projects using the additional ideas I have for it as the new requirments for the next project come up. The inspiration for my project came from my D&D group; and obiously Dark Souls. You see in my D&D group we use a website called DnDBeyond that saves all of our information about our characters and just makes keeping track of things so much easier. I themed my after Dark Souls because as I have said in a previous post Dark Souls is a challenging game that makes sure you use every skill you have learned even from the begining to beat the game and I think that parralells with coding very well.
